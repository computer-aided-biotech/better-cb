## Introduction

- Importance of computation in biological research and scope.
- Importance to reproducibility in computational biology.
- Mentioning previous literature and some of their major takeaways and topics not fully covered in here (what kind of languages to learn, advanced text editors/IDEs,
- The computational biology best-practices continuum: reproducibility at the personal level, sharing our research with others and over time.
- Addressing the audience: computational biologists researchers â€“ data analysts, workflow designers, software developers, mathematical modelers, etc.
- Structure of this manuscript: mention Figure 1 and Figure 2.
  - **Figure 1:** Funnel structure for better computational biology.
  - **Figure 2:** Types of computational biology projects per level.
