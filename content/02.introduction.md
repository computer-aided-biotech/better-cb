## Introduction

Since Margaret Dayhoff pioneered the field of bioinformatics back in the sixties, the application of computational tools to the field of biology has vastly grown in scope and impact. Nowadays, biotechnological and biomedical research are routinely fed by the insights arising from novel computational approaches, machine learning algorithms and mathematical models. The ever increasing amount of biological data and the exponential growth in computing power will amplify this trend in the years to come.

The use of computing to address biological questions encompasses a wide array of applications usually grouped under the terms of "computational biology" and "bioinformatics". Although distinct definitions have been delineated for each one [@url:https://www.kennedykrieger.org/sites/default/files/library/documents/research/center-labs-cores/bioinformatics/bioinformatics-def.pdf;@pmid:11552348], here we will consider both under the umbrella term “computational biology”, alluding to any application that involves the intersection of computing and biological data. As such, a computational biologist can be a data analyst, a data engineer, a statistician, a mathematical modeler, a software developer, and many others. In praxis, the modern computational biologist will be a “scientist of many hats”, taking on several of the duties listed above. But first and foremost, we will consider a computational biologist as a scientist whose ultimate goal is answering a biological question or addressing a need in the life sciences by means of computation.

Scientific computing requires following specific practices to enable shareable, reproducible and sustainable outputs. Computing-heavy disciplines, such as software engineering and data science, have adopted practices addressing the need for collaboration, visualization, project management, and strengthening of online communities. However, as a highly interdisciplinary and evolving field, computational biology has yet to acquire a set of universal "best practices". Since most computational biologists come from diverse backgrounds and rely on self-study rather formal education [@doi:10.1109/SANER.2018.8330263], the absence of guidelines may leave many computational biologists astray, engaging in unsustainable practices that hinder reproducibility and collaboration, slowing down biomedical and biotechnological research.

In recent years, the "guidelines gap" have being addressed by the definition of FAIR principles—Findability, Accessibility, Interoperability, and Reusability—coined in 2016 [@doi:10.1038/sdata.2016.18]. Originally develop for data stewardship, FAIR principles have been proposed as universal guidelines for all research objects [@doi:10.1016/j.patter.2021.100206]. However, how to translate these high-level principles into day-to-day practices requires nuance, accounting for the type of research object, the size and scope of the project, and the experience of the researcher. 

Over the last decade, several researchers have provided advice on good practices for scientific computing and computational biology. Recently, the framework ADVerTS (availability of software, documenting software, version control, testing, and support) has been proposed as a set of "barely sufficient" practices to address the need for FAIR scientific software. Other advice includes reviews introducing bench scientists new to computational biology to a wide range of topics ranging from programming to project organization [@doi:10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005510;doi:10.1371/journal.pbio.1001745; @doi:10.1093/gigascience/giz054, @doi:10.1038/nbt.2740], deep-dives into the use and applications of one powerful tool, such as the software development and version control cloud service GitHub [@doi:10.1371/journal.pcbi.1004947] and the web-application Jupyter Notebooks [@arxiv:1810.08055v1], or comprehensive reviews covering one specific need in computational biology, such as workflow automation [@doi:10.1101/2020.06.30.178673] and software library development [@doi:10.1016/j.cels.2017.08.003].

Although this advice proves immensely helpful, some aspects of the computational biology "journey" remain uncovered. Indeed, guiding principles and general advice are key to establish a behavior roadmap, but their actual implementation is enabled by incorporating the right tools into our daily working routine. Tool selection has many components, from availability to suitability to personal preference, and although the latter is left to the reader, here we will shed light over the first two. We premise that good practices in computational biology lie within a continuum that traverses three "levels": the individual’s personal practices, the collaborative practices of a team, and the practices that allow a broader scientific community to access and engage over time with the research (Figure {@fig:levels-fig}). Each one of these levels has a different set of needs and challenges, as well as a specific set of tools that can be used to address them. Here, we compiled a curated list of these tools, emphasizing their time and place in a computational biology research project. Committed to practicality, we illustrated the utility of these tools in case studies covering a wide spectrum of research topics that computational biologists can use to model their own practices, modifying them to suit their own needs and preferences.
