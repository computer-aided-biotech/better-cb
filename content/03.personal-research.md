## Level 1: Personal Research

Main goal: Manage a personal computational biology project for you and your future self.

I distinguish two main sub-goals: choose your toolbox (preferred programming language, applications and software),

### 1.1 Choose your toolbox

- Choose your language: R, Python, bash, others? Should be based on your objectives (e.g. is it mainly statistical analysis of data? will it be eventually packaged as a command line tool? do you require pre-existing code out there? (mention interfaces if more than one language is needed)
-  Where to start writing code: text editor (Sublime, Atom, Visual Studio Code), IDE and notebooks (RStudio, Jupyter Notebook, Jupyter Lab), CLI

**Table 1**: Choose your toolbox.

| Goal                              | Tool options                                                 | Additional remarks                                           |
| --------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Select your programming languages | &bull; Bash<br />&bull; R<br />&bull; Python<br />&bull; C/C++<br />&bull; Perl, Julia, Rust, etc. | Choose a your preferred languages based on your objectives.  |
| Select where to code              | &bull; Text editors: Sublime, Atom, Visual Studio Code, Vim, EMACS<br />&bull; Notebooks: Jupyter notebooks, R Markdown, Atom/nteract,<br />&bull; IDEs: R Studio, Jupyter Lab | Text editors support only text and offer a minimal interface. Some text editors are highly customizable. Notebooks support text, run code, and display images. IDEs include a text editor in addition to a compiler to run code, debuggers and other features. |

### 3.2 Manage your code

*  Literate programming: Markdown, R Markdown, Jupyter Notebooks.
*  Coding good practices (documentation, variable naming, linter, pep8, commenting, functions, modularize, paradigms)
*  Version control: Git and Git GUIs (GitHub Desktop, GitKraken), GitHub/GitLab/BitBucket

### 3.3 Manage your project/research

* How to organize your project structure: reproducible research template initiatives (basic ideas of keeping your data separate from code, versioning your results, etc)
* Software versioning and environment managers (Conda, pip, virtualenv, pyenv, python-env, etc.)
