## Level 1: Personal Research

The computational biology "journey" begins with you—more specifically, with the set of skills, tools and practices that you have in place to conduct your own research. Taking the time to optimally establish these building blocks will have high payoff later, when you go need to go back to your research. Consider that, ultimately, your most important collaborator is your future self, either of tomorrow or of ten years from now. To attend all the fundamental aspects that make up a solid ground to start any computational biology project, we devised a framework involving four main steps (Table 1).

### Step 1: Choose your programming languages

Different programming languages serve distinctive purposes and have different idiosyncrasies. As such, choosing the right programming language for a project depends on the intended output and personal preference or skill. Additionally, communities usually favor the usage and training of some programming languages over others; utilizing such languages may facilitate integrating your work within the existing ecosystem.

One of the most common outputs in computational biology is data analysis. This involves data cleaning, exploration, manipulation, and visualization.

As computational biology becomes a data intensive discipline, interacting with high-performance computing (HPC) operating systems has become a valuable skill. Commonly, HPC infrastructures use Unix/Linux distributions as its operating system. These platforms are usually operated from the command line using a command line interpreter, known as the "Unix shell". There are multiple versions of Unix shells, being Bash one of the most widely adopted. Besides providing an "user interface", the shell is also a scripting language that allows manipulating files and executing programs through "shell scripts".

### Step 2: Setup your working environment

Data analysis greatly benefits from using notebooks, instead of plain text editors or even IDEs. A notebook is an interactive application that combines code, narrative and visualizations. Common notebooks use either Python or R programming languages and narrative follows markdown syntax.

### Step 3: Define your project structure

### Step 4: Write "good" code

| Step                                          | Use case: common tools                                       |
| --------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Step 1:** Select your programming languages | &bull; Interacting with a Unix/Linux HPC: Shell/Bash<br />&bull; Data analysis: Python, R<br />&bull; Scrips and programs: Python, R, Perl<br />&bull; Programs (high-performance) : C/C++, Rust |
| **Step 2:** Setup your working environment    | &bull; Text editors: Atom, Sublime, Visual Studio Code, Vim, EMACS<br />&bull; Notebooks: Jupyter notebooks, R Markdown, Atom/nteract,<br />&bull; IDEs: R Studio, Jupyter Lab |
| **Step 3:** Define your project structure     | &bull; How to organize your project structure: reproducible research template initiatives (basic ideas of keeping your data separate from code, versioning your results, etc)<br />&bull; Software versioning and environment managers: Conda, pip, virtualenv, pyenv, python-env |
| **Step 4:** Write "good" code                 | &bull; Literate programming: Markdown, R Markdown, Jupyter Notebooks.<br />&bull; Coding good practices: documentation, variable naming, linter, pep8, commenting, functions, modularize, paradigms<br />&bull; Version control: Git and Git GUIs (GitHub Desktop, GitKraken), GitHub/GitLab/BitBucket |
