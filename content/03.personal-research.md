## Level 1: Personal Research

The computational biology "journey" begins with you—more specifically, with the set of skills, tools and practices that you have in place to conduct your research. Taking the time to optimally establish these building blocks will have high payoff later, when you find the need to go back to your research (which will certainly happen). Consider that your most important collaborator is your future self, either of tomorrow or ten years from now. To attend all the fundamental aspects that make up a solid ground to start any computational biology project, we devised a framework involving four main steps (Table 1).

### Step 1: Choose your programming languages

Different programming languages serve distinctive purposes and have different idiosyncrasies. As such, choosing the right programming language for a project depends on your research goals and personal preference or skill. Additionally, communities usually favor the usage and training of some programming languages over others; utilizing such languages may facilitate integrating your work within the existing ecosystem.

As computational biology becomes a data intensive discipline, interacting with high-performance computing (HPC) operating systems has become a hallmark of most computational biologist day-to-day job. Commonly, HPC infrastructures use Unix/Linux distributions as their operating system. These platforms are usually operated from the command line using a command line interpreter known as the "Unix shell". There are multiple versions of Unix shells, being Bash one of the most widely adopted. Besides providing an "user interface", the shell is also a scripting language that allows manipulating files and executing programs through "shell scripts". Unix/Linux operating systems have other interesting perks. There is an array of powerful and fast commands for searching and manipulating files—such as `sed`, `grep` or `join`—which we encourage to add to your coding repertoire. Additionally, the language AWK—a standard feature of Unix/Linux operating systems—can perform quick text processing tasks, including arithmetic operations.

One of the most common task of any computational biologist is data analysis. The job of a data analyst involves data cleaning, exploration, manipulation, and visualization.

* Scripts and tools, and high performance tools
* Research pipelines

### Step 2: Setup your working environment

* Text editors
* Notebooks: Data analysis greatly benefits from using notebooks, instead of plain text editors or even IDEs. A notebook is an interactive application that combines code, narrative and visualizations. Common notebooks use either Python or R programming languages and narrative follows markdown syntax.
* IDEs

### Step 3: Define your project structure

* Research templates
* Package managers: A **package manager** or **package**-**management** system is a collection of software tools that automates the process of installing, upgrading, configuring, and removing computer programs for a computer's operating system in a consistent manner.
* Environment managers

### Step 4: Write high-quality code

* Coding good practices
* Version control
