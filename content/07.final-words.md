## Final words

Good practices in the computational biology field have gained spotlight among researchers thanks to the several guiding principles published in recent years as well as the increasing usage of Git-based repositories and workflow managers.  This review adds to the existing literature by introducing a comprehensive list of good practices and associated tools that can be applied to any computational biology project, regardless of the specific subfield or the experience of the researcher.

We are aware that the many tools and practices introduced in this study and their ever-changing nature may seem overwhelming, especially for someone new to the field. To overcome this, we encourage you to implement only a few practices and tools first, starting from your personal research, and expand your repertoire over time. More importantly than any specific tools is keeping a mindset of striving for reproducibility, regardless of the tools used. We are also aware that we may have left many relevant tools behind and that, as time progresses, many new tools will be released. This means that updated versions of reviews like this one will always be essential to help new computational biologist enter the field as well as to keep experienced computational biologists up to date with the latest trends. 

In the midst of our work, under the many pressures of academic research, we can forget to keep good computational practices in place. In such scenario, the consequences will not be seen immediately, but instead the consequences will be seen in the long run. As all scientific endeavors, computational biology heavily relies on building new knowledge from previous one; as such, the good practices that we adopt will act as building blocks for the overall reproducibility of the field, propelling novel and exciting discoveries.
