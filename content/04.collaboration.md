## Level 2: Collaboration

Collaboration is a key aspect of all scientific research, but it is especially relevant in computational biology, where interdisciplinary knowledge is often needed. Collaborators can take different forms: your boss or advisor, colleagues or lab mates, other laboratories, people from academia or industry, or your future self (as discussed in Level 1). Although collaborators can have a wide range of involvement with your project—from co-authors to commenters—they all share a direct relationship with you and your research, comprising a closed group of a dozen of people at most (contrary to a community, which is an open group of a large number of people, as we will discuss in Level 3). Each type of collaboration requires its own set of good practices, which we will cover in the next paragraphs.

### 2.1 Share data science notebooks

As we previously discussed, Jupyter Notebook have become a fundamental tool of data analytics. Accordingly, you will likely need to share your notebook with collaborators at some point. To do this, there are static and interactive options. The former, as the name indicates, share computational notebooks as a rendered text, written internally in HTML. Static notebooks are a good option when you want to avoid any modifications and can work as an archive of past analyses, but interacting with its content is cumbersome—the file must be downloaded and run in a local Jupyter installation. Git-based code repositories, such as GitHub and GitLab, automatically render notebooks that can be later shared pointing collaborators to the GitHub repository. To ease this process, the Project Jupyter provides a web application called nbviewer, where you can paste a Jupyter Notebook's URL, publicly hosted in GitHub or elsewhere, and renders the file into a static HTML web page with a stable link. 

Interactive notebooks, in the other hand, not only render the file but also allow collaborators to fully interact with it, tinkering parameters or trying new input data—no installation required. The Binder Projects (which is also part of the Project Jupyter) offers the Binder service, where any publicly hosted Git-based repository can be open with a Jupyter Notebook interface. The user can fully interact with any notebook within the repository, although changes will not be saved to the original file. The platforms supports Python and R among other languages, but any additional packages required  to run the analysis need to be specified in a configuration file within the repository. Similarly, Jupyter Notebooks can be run interactively using Google CoLaboratory (CoLab), which is available to anyone with a Google account. Notebooks can be updated locally, from any public GitHub repository, or from Google Drive, where also imported files are also saved. In both cases, the machines provided by these services are comparable to a modern laptop. Thus, these tools are not suitable for some computing-intensive tasks common to computational biology problems.

Besides sharing notebooks, often	times computational biologists need to work and edit together a notebook. In those cases, notebooks need to be treated as any other piece of code: updates from different collaborators must be managed with version control in a platform such as GitHub. The problem, however, is that Git-based tools deal with notebooks as if they were HTML text, where changes between version are really hard to visualize. To better compare changes in a notebook in GitHub, there is NBreview, where the old and new versions of the notebooks are rendered for easy comparison. The tool can be easily installed using your GitHub account, and notebooks can be review from their website.

### 2.2 Share code

-  Share code: Git branching, simple GitFlow, code review (good reviewing practices) and good coding practices (linter, style guides) 

### 2.3 Share computational workflows

Computational biology often demands integrating multi-step analyses using third-party tools with dozens of intermediate files. The

### 2.4Tests (add better name)

-  Make tests: test correctness (pytest), test coverage (codecov), implement test pipeline (tox, Travis CI, GitHub actions) B

###  2.5 Write manuscripts collaboratively

Writing articles is arguably the main way where we can share our research with the scientific community and for that purpose, the world. However, in a highly interdisciplinary field as computational biology, writing manuscripts is also a collaborative effort, where multiple people is directly involved in the crafting of a manuscripts. The traditional computer tools for writing documents, therefore, are oftentimes not suitable for this type of collaboration, resulting in files with different names jumping from one e-mail inbox to another, resulting in multiple and likely contradictory final versions. Let's avoid this by streamline collaborative manuscript writing with tools made for that purpose.

Big companies have become aware of the need for collaborative writing, developing online applications that can be simultaneously edited by multiple people. Google's GDocs and Microsoft's Office 365 are well-known word processors designed for this purpose, where the text is displayed with the exact appearance than in a printout (know as _What-You-See-Is-What-You-Get_ , or WYSIWYG) and the text can be formatted making use of the internal features of the application. The advantage of these technologies is that they are extremely user-friendly, and require no additional knowledge. They are a good option when one or more of your collaborators seeks simplicity, but they are not specifically tailored for the needs of scientific writing, such as adding references, equations and figures. Fortunately, third-party companies have developed plugins for these applications to add references to your document. Companies like Authorea have developed their own online application specifically designed for writing manuscripts. Authorea, in particular, offers templates for different type of research projects, allows you to manage collaborators from the same platform, and easily add reference from using identifiers (DOI, PubMed, etc.). Consider, nonetheless, that some collaborators may not want to adopt a new tool exclusively for writing manuscripts.

In addition to word editors, text editors are a competitive option to write manuscripts when combined with a markup language—a human-readable computer language that uses tags to delineate formatting elements in a document that will be later rendered. Since the formatting process is internally handled by the application, styling elements (headers, text formatting, equations) can be easily written in text, even achieving greater consistency than word processors. Disciplines closely related to computational biology, such as statistics and mathematics, have historically used the markup language LaTeX for writing articles. This language has a specific syntax to write mathematics constructs as simple text, making it a sound choice for papers with lots of equations. To aid collaborative writing, platforms like Overleaf provide online LaTeX editors, supporting features like real-time editing. In addition to LaTeX, an emerging trend in collaborative writing is to use the lightweight markup language Markdown within the GitHub infrastructure. The software Manubot provides a set of functionalities to write scholarly articles within a GitHub repository, leveraging all the advantages of Git version control and the GitHub hosting platform [@doi:10.1371/journal.pcbi.1007128]. For example, it provides cloud storage, version control, and facilitates the maintainers' work by managing updates via pull requests. The GitHub user interface also allows off-line discussions about the manuscript using issues" and task assignment (See level 3 for tips on project management). Manubot, in particular, accepts citations using manuscripts identifiers and renders automatically renders the article in PDF and HTML formats. As a drawback, it requires technical expertise in Git and familiarity with GitHub; as an upside, its reliable infrastructure scales well to large and open collaborative projects.
