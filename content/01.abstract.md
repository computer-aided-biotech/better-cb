## Abstract{.page_break_before}

As biotechnological and biomedical research are increasingly fed by the insights arising from computation, the conversation about good practices in computational biology is becoming more prominent in recent years. An increasing body of literature is starting to address practices for shareable, reproducible, and sustainable computational research, from high-level principles for data and software stewardship to deep-dives into version control or software automation. The actual implementation of good practices, however, relies on incorporating the right tools into our daily routines, considering the type, scope and stage of the research project. Here we provide a compendium of relevant tools for computational biology research, emphasizing their time and place within a continuum that traverses personal practices, the collaborative practices of a team, and the practices required to interact with a community at large. This compendium will serve as a starting point and as a consulting guide to help navigate the ongoing influx of tools and how to best incorporate them into a computational biologist daily working routine, enabling reproducible biomedical and biotechnological research in the long term.
