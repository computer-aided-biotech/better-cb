## Level 3: Community

Main goal: develop and maintain a computational biology project with community engagement over time

At this level, we can distinguish 3 sub-goals: Make your research easily accessible and reproducible, make your research usable as a tool, and support your users over time. The latter two are only really relevant when part research involves developing a tool, but we believe that many of those ideas are relevant for any computational biology project as well.

### 3.1. Make your research accessible

Goal: Open research.

Licensing (MIT, Apache, GNU, CC): Define who can use your research

| Tool Name | Goal | Useful scenario |
|---|-----|------|
| Licensing Options [@https://choosealicense.com/licenses] | Indicate how can people use your code. | Always necessary. |
| Releases [@https://docs.github.com/github/administering-a-repository/managing-releases-in-a-repository] | Keep track of stable versions of your code. | You routinely create new versions of your code. |
| Semantic versioning  [@https://semver.org] | Assign standard identifiers to each version of your code. | You routinely create new versions of your code. |
| Zenodo [@https://zenodo.org] | Assign a DOI to each version of your code. | You would like any version of your code to be citable. |
| PyPI [@https://pypi.org] | Produce a python package easy to install and use. | Potential Python userbase. |
| Bioconda [@https://bioconda.github.io] | Produce an R package easy to install and use. | Potential R userbase. |
| Bioconductor [@https://www.bioconductor.org]  | Produce an R package easy to install and use. | Potential R userbase. |
| Dash [@https://plotly.com/dash] | Provide easy data exploration to your users. | Your research includes data which can be visualized in different ways with Python. |
| R-Shiny [@https://shiny.rstudio.com] | Provide easy data exploration to your users. | Your research includes data which can be visualized in different ways with R. |

Table: Tools for making your research accessible. In each case, the main goal of the tool, together with an example on a scenario where it is especially useful, are shown. {#tbl:community-tools-1}

GitHub/Zenodo releases: Archive your research for the future. Also mention semantic versioning

Developing packages (PyPI, Bioconda, Bioconductor): Reach a bigger audience

Developing apps (R Shiny, Python/Dash): Let users interact with your results

### 3.2. Make your research reproducible

Documentation (Wiki, Github Pages, readthedocs (which uses sphinx), gitbook): Guide your users. Mention the 4 types of documentation, denote differences between reStructuredText and markdown.

| Tool Name | Goal | Useful scenario |
|--|-------|-----|
| Github Pages [@https://pages.github.com] | Provide a landing page to any repository. | Short documentation. |
| Readthedocs [@https://readthedocs.org] | Document research using reStructuredText [@https://docutils.sourceforge.io/rst.html] language. | Comprehensive documentation. |
| Gitbook [@https://www.gitbook.com] | Document research using Markdown [@https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax] language. | Comprehensive documentation. |
| Docker [@https://www.docker.com] | Package your research as a container ready to run in any computer. | Cross-platform users. |
| Singularity [@https://sylabs.io] | Package your research as a container ready to run in any computer. | Cross-platform users. |
| pip-tools [@https://github.com/jazzband/pip-tools] | Create different environments depending on who accesses your research. | Many conditional dependencies. |
| Binder [@https://mybinder.org] | Make your notebooks interactive and reproducible. | Most of your research is done through notebooks. |
| Make [@https://www.gnu.org/software/make] | Build a program by following a series of steps. | Many installation steps. |
| Snakemake [@https://snakemake.readthedocs.io] | Enable reproducible scientific workflows, using a Python-based language.  | Your study includes a workflow. |
| Nextflow [@https://www.nextflow.io] | Enable reproducible scientific workflows, using Groovy [@https://groovy-lang.org]. | Your study includes a workflow. |

Table: Tools for making your research reproducible. In each case, the main goal of the tool, together with an example on a scenario where it is especially useful, are shown. {#tbl:community-tools-2}

Docker/Singularity containers, pip-tools: Ensure your research is reproducible by anyone

Binder for reproducible notebooks

Developing reproducible workflows (Make, Snakemake, Nextflow)

### 3.3. Make your research sustainable

Goal: fostering a strong user community over time.

Community engagement (Gitter, Google groups, other forums): Communicate with your users. You can have more than 1, for different purposes.

| Tool Name | Goal | Useful scenario |
|---|-------|-----|
| Gitter [@https://gitter.im] | Provide a quick way for users to contact you for specific questions. | Small user community. |
| Google groups [@https://groups.google.com/forum/m] | Provide a way for users to contact you with larger issues. | Bigger user community. |
| Issues [@https://guides.github.com/features/issues] | Detail specific pending to-do's in your research / allow others to request changes. | Always useful. |
| Contribution guidelines [@https://docs.github.com/github/building-a-strong-community/setting-guidelines-for-repository-contributors] | Guide users and collaborators on how to open issues / contribute improvements. | You would like researchers to contribute code. |
| Contributor Covenant [@https://www.contributor-covenant.org] | Foster a healthy and respectful community of collaborators. | You would like researchers to contribute code. |
| Wiki [@https://docs.github.com/github/building-a-strong-community/about-wikis] | Clarify development/administering guidelines with how-to guides. | You have collaborators sending you contributions. |
| Projects [@https://github.com/features/project-management] | Organize your issues in a Kanban-style [@https://www.atlassian.com/agile/kanban] flowchart. | Project with multiple features/fixes to do. |
| Zenhub [@https://www.zenhub.com] | Keep track of your pending tasks in different projects with Agile [@https://agilemanifesto.org] software development practices. | Your research is split in many different repositories. |
| Gitflow [@https://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model] | Safely develop when several developers contribute code to the project. | Users need stable versions of your research in an ongoing project.  |

Table: Tools for making your research reproducible. In each case, the main goal of the tool, together with an example on a scenario where it is especially useful, are shown. {#tbl:community-tools-3}

Issues (GitHub issues/milestones/labels/templates): Have a to-do list

Development Guidelines + code of conduct

Project management (GitHub projects, Zenhub, Agile, Scrum, Kanban): Maintain software and prioritize tasks

Full GitFlow (master/devel/hotfix branches): Ensure nothing breaks + Continuous integration (same as before but w/higher standards + automatic releasing): Do less, script more
