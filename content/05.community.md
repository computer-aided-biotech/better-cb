## Level 3: Community

Main goal: develop and maintain a computational biology project with community engagement over time

At this level, we can distinguish 3 sub-goals: Make your research accessible, reproducible and sustainable. The latter is especially relevant when part of the research involves developing code that will be used by others in the future (e.g. a tool or workflow), but we believe that many of those ideas are relevant for any computational biology project as well.

### 3.1. Make your research accessible

Goal: Open research.

Hosting repos online + Licensing (MIT, Apache, GNU, CC): Define who can use your research

| Goal | Tool options | Additional remarks |
|---|------|--------|
| Publish your code | &bull; **Github** [@https://github.com]<br/>&bull; **Gitlab** [@https://gitlab.com]<br/>&bull; **Bitbucket** [@https://bitbucket.org] | All three options allow you to host your repository online for free. Choose whichever is more used in your own field. |
| Share your code | &bull; Several licensing options [@https://choosealicense.com/licenses]. | Indicate with a license file what restrictions apply when using your code. If you don't include this, you will loose many users. |
| Archive your code | &bull; **Github Releases** [@https://docs.github.com/github/administering-a-repository/managing-releases-in-a-repository]<br/>&bull; **Zenodo** [@https://zenodo.org]: Make your releases citable with a DOI. | Share progressive stable versions of your code as you develop it. Use **semantic versioning** [@https://semver.org] for assigning standard identifiers to your releases. |
| Publish a tool | &bull; **PyPI** [@https://pypi.org]: Python.<br/>&bull; **CRAN** [@https://cran.r-project.org]: R.<br/>&bull;  **Bioconductor** [@https://www.bioconductor.org]: R.<br/>&bull; **Bioconda** [@https://bioconda.github.io]: Language-agnostic. | Produce a package easy to install and use. Especially useful if you think you could have a userbase that will run the same analysis as you on other datasets and/or conditions. |
| Publish an app | &bull; **Dash** [@https://plotly.com/dash]: Python.<br/>&bull;  **R-Shiny** [@https://shiny.rstudio.com]: R. | Provide easy and interactive data exploration to your users. Especially useful if you have large datasets that can be explored in different ways. |

Table: Tools for making your research accessible. For each highlighted goal, different tools that achieve that goal, together with additional remarks, are shown. {#tbl:community-tools-1}

GitHub/Zenodo releases: Archive your research for the future. Also mention semantic versioning

Developing packages (PyPI, Bioconda, Bioconductor, CRAN): Reach a bigger audience

Developing apps (R Shiny, Python/Dash): Let users interact with your results

### 3.2. Make your research reproducible

Value of reproducibility

Documentation (readthedocs (which uses sphinx), gitbook): Guide your users. Mention the 4 types of documentation, denote differences between reStructuredText and markdown.

| Goal | Tool options | Additional remarks |
|---|-------|------|
| Document your code | &bull; **Readthedocs** [@https://readthedocs.org]: Uses **reStructuredText** [@https://docutils.sourceforge.io/rst.html].<br/>&bull; **Gitbook** [@https://www.gitbook.com]: Uses **Markdown** [@https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax]. | Comprehensive documentation: from usage instructions to function documentation based on all compiled **docstrings** [@https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/python-docstrings]. |
| Reproducible environments | &bull; **Environment managers**: See TABLE XXX.<br/>&bull; **pip-tools** [@https://github.com/jazzband/pip-tools]: Administer several environments in a single project. | As a recommendation, try having the minimum number of dependencies needed to reproduce your results. |
| Reproducible code | &bull; **Docker** [@https://www.docker.com]<br/>&bull; **Singularity** [@https://sylabs.io] | Package your research as a container ready to run in any computer. |
| Reproducible notebooks | &bull; **Binder** [@https://mybinder.org] | Make your notebooks interactive and reproducible. |
| Reproducible pipelines | &bull; **Make** [@https://www.gnu.org/software/make] | Build a program by following a series of steps in a single Makefile. |
| Reproducible workflows | &bull; **Snakemake** [@https://snakemake.readthedocs.io]: Uses a Python-based language.<br/>&bull; **Nextflow** [@https://www.nextflow.io]: Uses **Groovy** [@https://groovy-lang.org]. | Run a pipeline of commands on NGS data in a reproducible way. |

Table: Tools for making your research reproducible. For each highlighted goal, different tools that achieve that goal, together with additional remarks, are shown. {#tbl:community-tools-2}

Docker/Singularity containers, pip-tools: Ensure your research is reproducible by anyone

Binder for reproducible notebooks

Developing reproducible workflows (Make, Snakemake, Nextflow)

### 3.3. Make your research sustainable

Goal: fostering a strong user community over time.

Welcome your users (readme, Github Pages)

| Goal | Tool options | Additional remarks |
|---|-----|-------|
| Welcome your users | &bull; **README file** [@https://www.makeareadme.com]: First file that shows up in a repository. <br/>&bull; **Github Pages** [@https://pages.github.com]: Separate website. | Provide a landing page to any repository with a short overview of the code (installation, usage, acknowledgments, etc). |
| Tell users how to contact you | &bull; **Gitter** [@https://gitter.im]: Specific questions.<br/>&bull; **Google groups** [@https://groups.google.com/forum/m]: Larger issues / how-to's. | Provide ways for users to contact you for questions, requests, etc. Remember to visit them periodically! |
| Track to-do's in your research | &bull; **Issues** [@https://guides.github.com/features/issues] | Detail specific pending to-do's in your research / allow others to request changes and/or highlight bugs. |
| Encourage user contributions | &bull; **Contribution guidelines** [@https://docs.github.com/github/building-a-strong-community/setting-guidelines-for-repository-contributors]: How to open issues / contribute code.<br/>&bull; **Github Wikis** [@https://docs.github.com/github/building-a-strong-community/about-wikis]: More specific how-to guides. | Provide as much information as you can to guide your users. You can also include administrator guidelines. |
| Foster a respectful community | &bull; **Contributor Covenant** [@https://www.contributor-covenant.org]: Smaller projects.<br/>&bull; **Citizen Code of Conduct** [@https://github.com/stumpsyn/policies/blob/master/citizen_code_of_conduct.md]: Larger projects. | Essential when you would like researchers to contribute code. |
| Keep track of your issues | &bull; **Github Projects** [@https://github.com/features/project-management]: Uses a **Kanban** [@https://www.atlassian.com/agile/kanban] flowchart.<br/>&bull; **Zenhub** [@https://www.zenhub.com]: Uses **Scrum** [@https://www.scrum.org/resources/what-is-scrum] practices. | Keep track of your pending tasks in different projects with **Agile** [@https://agilemanifesto.org] software development practices. Especially useful if your research is split in many different repositories, each with multiple features/fixes to do. |
| Branch your repo sustainably | &bull; **Gitflow** [@https://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model] | Useful when several developers contribute code to the project. Allows users to get access to stable versions of your research in an ongoing project. |

Table: Tools for making your research reproducible. For each highlighted goal, different tools that achieve that goal, together with additional remarks, are shown. {#tbl:community-tools-3}

Community engagement (Gitter, Google groups, other forums): Communicate with your users. You can have more than 1, for different purposes.

Issues (GitHub issues/milestones/labels/templates): Have a to-do list

Development Guidelines + wikis + code of conduct

Project management (GitHub projects, Zenhub, Agile, Scrum, Kanban): Maintain software and prioritize tasks

Full GitFlow (master/devel/hotfix branches): Ensure nothing breaks + Continuous integration (same as before but w/higher standards + automatic releasing): Do less, script more
