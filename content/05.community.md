## Level 3: Community

Main goal: develop and maintain a computational biology project with community engagement over time

At this level, we can distinguish 3 sub-goals: Make your research easily accessible and reproducible, make your research usable as a tool, and support your users over time. The latter two are only really relevant when part research involves developing a tool, but we believe that many of those ideas are relevant for any computational biology project as well.

### 1. Make your research ready for the community

Paragraph on full GitFlow (master/devel/hotfix branches): Ensure nothing breaks

| Tool Name | Description | Useful scenario |
|--|------|-----|
| [Gitflow](https://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/) | Branching approach that allows for safe development when many developers contribute code to the project. | Users need different versions of your code. |
| [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) | Package your research as a container ready to run in any computer. | Cross-platform users. |
| [Singularity](https://sylabs.io/) | Package your research as a container ready to run in any computer. | Cross-platform users. |
| [pip-tools](https://github.com/jazzband/pip-tools) | Create different environments depending on who accesses your research. | Many conditional dependencies. |
| [Licensing Options](https://choosealicense.com/licenses/) | File that indicates how can people use your code. | Always necessary. |
| [Releases](https://docs.github.com/github/administering-a-repository/managing-releases-in-a-repository) | Keep track of stable versions of your code. | You continuously create new versions of your code. |
| [Semantic versioning](https://semver.org/) | Convention that assigns standard identifiers to each version of your code. | You continuously create new versions of your code. |
| [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/) | Repository which stores versions of your code and assigns DOIs to each one. | You would like any version of your code to be citable. |

Table: Tools for making your research reproducible and sustainable. In each case, the main goal of the tool, together with an example on a scenario where it is especially useful, are shown. {#tbl:community-tools-1}

Paragraph on Docker/Singularity containers, pip-tools: Ensure your research is reproducible by anyone

Paragraph on Licensing (MIT, Apache, GNU, CC): Define who can use your research

Paragraph on GitHub/Zenodo releases: Archive your research for the future. Also mention semantic versioning

### 2. Package your research as a tool

Paragraph on developing packages (PyPI, Bioconda): Reach a bigger audience

| Tool Name | Description | Useful scenario |
|--|------|-----|
| PyPI |  |  |
| Bioconda |  |  |
| R-Shiny |  |  |
| Python/Dash |  |  |
| Make |  |  |
| Snakemake |  |  |
| Nextflow |  |  |

Table: Tools for packaging your research as a tool. In each case, the main goal of the tool, together with an example on a scenario where it is especially useful, are shown. {#tbl:community-tools-2}

Paragraph on developing apps (R Shiny, Python/Dash): Let users interact with your results

Paragraph on developing workflows (Make, Snakemake, Nextflow)

### 3. Support your users over time

Documentation (Wiki, Development Guidelines, code of conduct, Github Pages, readthedocs, gitbook): Guide your users

| Tool Name | Description | Useful scenario |
|--|------|-----|
| Wiki |  |  |
| [Contribution guidelines](https://docs.github.com/github/building-a-strong-community/setting-guidelines-for-repository-contributors) |  |  |
| [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/) |  | |
| Github Pages |  |  |
| Readthedocs |  |  |
| Gitbook |  |  |
| Gitter |  |  |
| Google groups |  |  |
| Projects/Milestones/Labels |  |  |
| Zenhub |  |  |
| Scrum |  |  |

Table: Tools and useful links for fostering a strong user community over time. In each case, the main goal of the tool, together with an example on a scenario where it is especially useful, are shown. {#tbl:community-tools-3}

Continuous integration (same as before but w/higher standards + automatic releasing): Do less, script more

Community engagement (issue templates, Gitter, Google groups, other forums): Communicate with your users

Project management (GitHub projects/milestones/labels, Zenhub, Scrum): Maintain software and prioritize tasks
