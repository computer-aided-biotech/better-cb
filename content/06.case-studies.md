## Case study 1: Differential gene expression

Differential gene expression (DGE) analysis is a routine research tool in the field of functional genomics. Its main goal is to determine quantitative changes in gene expression levels between different experimental conditions or different populations. Nowadays, given the availability of NGS technologies, most DGE analysis are based on RNA-seq data, being the primary application of the technology [@doi:10.1038/s41576-019-0150-2]. 

For this case study, we will consider a study designed by a researcher to gain insights regarding a specific condition of interest, leading to interest genes that can be functionally characterized in animal models afterwards. The experimental setup included a control group and an experimental group with the condition of interest, both sequenced using RNA-seq. The experiment was conducted four times independently to reach a total of four replicates per group.

In this example, the most relevant part is personal research. Following this work's framework, the first step is to decide your programming languages. In this example, our bioinformatics analysis will include a first step performed in the command line, where we trim raw reads, align them to a reference, and count reads per transcripts. This will be followed by a second step for data filtering and statistical analysis in R. Thus, we will use Shell and R. The folder structure must have separated spaces for raw data, results, documentation and scripts used in the analysis. Since this is a fairly simple structure, we can clone the RR-init template into our HPC. Given that most of the software required is available in Bioconductor and Bioconda, the best option for this project will be to use a Conda environment with R installed, where we can download packages from Bioconductor and Bioconda.  We will edit code using Vim from the HPC part, and R Studio for the second part. When writing code in R, we will follow literate programming, using comments to explain every step of the analysis. The script folder will be tracked using the version control system Git, and every time we change a file we will commit the updates.
